==========
NextDenovo
==========

NextDenovo is a string graph-based *de novo* assembler for long reads (CLR, HiFi and ONT). It uses a "correct-then-assemble" strategy similar to canu (no correction step for PacBio HiFi reads), but requires significantly less computing resources and storages. After assembly, the per-base accuracy is about 98-99.8%, to further improve single base accuracy, please use `NextPolish <https://github.com/Nextomics/NextPolish>`_.

NextDenovo contains two core modules: NextCorrect and NextGraph. NextCorrect can be used to correct long noisy reads with approximately 15% sequencing errors, and NextGraph can be used to construct a string graph with corrected reads. It also contains a modified version of `minimap2 <https://github.com/lh3/minimap2>`_ and some useful utilities (see :ref:`utilities <utilities>` for more details).

We benchmarked NextDenovo against other assemblers using Oxford Nanopore long reads from :ref:`human <chm13_120x_ont>` and :ref:`Drosophila melanogaster <dmel_69x_ont>`, and PacBio continuous long reads (CLR) from :ref:`Arabidopsis thaliana <alta_192x_clr>`. NextDenovo produces more contiguous assemblies with fewer contigs compared to the other tools. NextDenovo also shows a high assembly accurate level in terms of assembly consistency and single-base accuracy.

Quick Start
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Prepare input.fofn

   .. code-block:: shell

      ls reads1.fasta reads2.fastq reads3.fasta.gz reads4.fastq.gz ... > input.fofn
#. Create run.cfg

   .. code-block:: shell

      cp doc/run.cfg ./
   
   .. note:: Please set :ref:`read_type <read_type>` and :ref:`genome_size <genome_size>`, and refer to :ref:`doc/FAQ <how-to-optimize-parallel-computing-parameters>` and :ref:`doc/OPTION <options>` to optimize parallel computing parameters.

#. Run

   .. code-block:: shell

      nextDenovo run.cfg

#. Result

   -  Sequence: ``01_rundir/03.ctg_graph/nd.asm.fasta``
   -  Statistics: ``01_rundir/03.ctg_graph/nd.asm.fasta.stat``

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. NextDenovo is optimized for assembly with seed\_cutoff >= 10kb. This should not be a big problem because it only requires the longest 30x-45x seeds length >= 10kb. For shorter seeds, it may produce unexpected results for some complex genomes and need be careful to check the quality.
